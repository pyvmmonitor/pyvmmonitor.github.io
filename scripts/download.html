        Older versions may be downloaded from <a href="%(all_versions_url)s">MediaFire</a>

        <br/>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Mac OS support is not currently available for PyVmMonitor 2.0.
        <br/>
        <hr/>
        <h3>Requisites</h3>
        In order to work properly at its best, PyVmMonitor also requires yappi:  <a href="https://github.com/sumerc/yappi/">https://github.com/sumerc/yappi/</a><br/>
        <br/>
        Note: since version 1.0.1, pre-built binaries are distributed along PyVmMonitor in Windows for some Python versions (other configurations still needs to
        compile or get it pre-built from somewhere else -- such as <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/">http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/</a>).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If you can't get a pre-built binary, you should get its sources and compile it in your machine. The simple steps to do are:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <pre style="font-family: Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace; color: #000000; background-color: #eee; font-size: 12px; border: 1px dashed #999999; line-height: 14px; padding: 5px; overflow: auto; width: 100%">
          <code style="color:#000000;word-wrap:normal;">
pip install yappi
</code></pre>
        Note that it'll build a binary extension, so, make sure you have a compiler properly configured for your Python version.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <hr/>
        <strong>Instaling on Windows</strong>: after downloading PyVmMonitor, double-click the installer and follow the steps!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <hr/>
        <strong>Instaling on Linux</strong>: after downloading the .tar.gz, and moving it to the proper folder, extract it to where you'd like:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        tar xvf pyvmmonitor.tar.gz
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Then, create a link to start it using 'pyvmmonitor-ui' from anywhere with: 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        
        sudo ln -s `pwd`/pyvmmonitor/pyvmmonitor-ui /usr/bin/pyvmmonitor-ui 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        (or alternatively, just execute pyvmmonitor/pyvmmonitor-ui) 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>Note:</strong> it's possible that it complains about <strong>libblas.so.3</strong> not being there, in this case, please install the needed deps:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <pre style="font-family: Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace; color: #000000; background-color: #eee; font-size: 12px; border: 1px dashed #999999; line-height: 14px; padding: 5px; overflow: auto; width: 100%">
          <code style="color:#000000;word-wrap:normal;">
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
</code></pre>
        <strong>Note:</strong> attach to process may not work if ptrace is not configured properly.
