        <h3>Requisites</h3>
        In order to work properly at its best, PyVmMonitor also requires yappi:  <a href="https://code.google.com/p/yappi/">https://code.google.com/p/yappi/</a><br/>
        <br/>
        Note: since version 0.6.0, pre-built binaries are distributed along PyVmMonitor in Windows for Python 2.7 32/64 bits and Python 3.4 32 bits (any other configuration still needs to
        compile or get it pre-built from somewhere else -- such as <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/">http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/</a>).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If you can't get a pre-built binary, you should get its sources and compile it in your machine. The simple steps to do are:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <pre style="font-family: Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace; color: #000000; background-color: #eee; font-size: 12px; border: 1px dashed #999999; line-height: 14px; padding: 5px; overflow: auto; width: 100%">
          <code style="color:#000000;word-wrap:normal;">
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/sumerc/yappi
cd yappi
python setup.py install

</code></pre>
        Note that it'll build a binary extension, so, make sure you have a compiler properly configured for your Python version.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Note that you also need Mercurial (usually just pip install mercurial -- although the compiler is also required for its speedups).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <hr/>
        <strong>Instaling on Windows</strong>: after downloading PyVmMonitor, double-click the installer and follow the steps!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <hr/>
        <strong>Instaling on Mac OS</strong>: Download the .dmg file, mount it as a disk and copy it (drag it) to the Applications dir.
        
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>Important for 0.5.0</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        during the freezing process for version 0.5.0, the file <strong>libSystem.B.dylib</strong> was inadvertently added to the distribution
        and will make starting PyVmMonitor fail depending on your Mac OS version, so, it has to be manually removed to successfully start PyVmMonitor.<br/>
        <br/>
        The file to be removed is located at: /PyVmMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/libSystem.B.dylib.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>Important:</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>

        On latest Mac OS X versions, after extracting the DMG, when executing PyVmMonitor.app, you may get an error such as:
        <br/>
        <br/>

        "PyVmMonitor.app" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        This happens because PyVmMonitor isn't currently signed or distributed through the Mac App Store.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        To overcome this, right-click the file, choose 'open' and confirm -- instead of double-clicking it (note that
        this must be done only once, subsequent attempts to open with double-click should work properly).
        <br/>
        <br/>

        Alternatively, it's possible to go to <strong>System Preferences > Security & Privacy</strong> and change "<strong>Allow Applications Downloaded
        From</strong>" to "<strong>Anywhere</strong>". You have to click the lock on the bottom to make changes. Once you start up PyVmMonitor.app, you can
        change it back to "Mac App Store and identified developers".
        <br/>

        <br/>
        <br/>
        <hr/>
        <strong>Instaling on Linux</strong>: after downloading the .tar.gz, and moving it to the proper folder, extract it to where you'd like:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        tar xvf pyvmmonitor.tar.gz
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Then, create a link to start it using 'pyvmmonitor-ui' from anywhere with: 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        
        sudo ln -s `pwd`/pyvmmonitor/pyvmmonitor-ui /usr/bin/pyvmmonitor-ui 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        (or alternatively, just execute pyvmmonitor/pyvmmonitor-ui) 
        <br/>
        <br/>
