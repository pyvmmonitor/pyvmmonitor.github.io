        <h4>UI improvements</h4>
        <ul>
            * Alt+Back goes to previous location.
            
            * Geometry is persisted upon restarts of the application.
            
            * If attached process finishes, it's shown in the UI.
            
            * PStats view save how it was sorted (cumulative/internal) and scroll location.
            
            * When we start profiling, the UI should show that properly (i.e.: update ui from backend).
            
            * When selecting editor in new line, its title is changed.
            
            * If we deselect/select editor, it no longer reloads the contents if nothing changed.
            
            * Silencing exception at shutdown when sampling.
            
            * Find working in internal editor.
            
            * Show visual indication if internal editor is dirty/saved.
            
            
            * It's possible to disconnect from a process.
            
            * Fixed UnicodeDecodeError if target file has accents.
            
            * Fixed issue where incompatible Qt library from host machin was being loaded.
            
            * When opening pstat/dot file a .* option was added.
            
            * Don't connect to pids we're already connected.
            
            * The grouped statistics visual state is kept on deselect/select.
            
            * The existing tabs may be closed (editor, pstats, dot, etc).
            
            * Draw the layout with arrows (instead of circle!).
            
            * About was created.
            
            * Provide a separate button for saving in pstats format (not only in hidden menu).
            
            * On live tree view, expand to leaf (first child to the end).
            
            * Provide a way to have only a single PyVMMonitor active (or at most one at each port it's listening to).
