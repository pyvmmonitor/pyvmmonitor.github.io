        PyVMMonitor can attach to a running CPython program. To use this feature select 'Connect to
        a running process' in the initial page.

            After connecting to a running application, a live view will be shown where it's possible
            to start/stop an on-the fly profile session using <a href="https://code.google.com/p/yappi/">yappi</a>.
            Note: yappi 0.94 onwards is required and must be already available in your application's PYTHONPATH. 
        <br/>

        <br/>
            When the profile session is stopped, an item with the results will appear in the tree.
            Selecting it allows us to sort the profile results as wanted and provides a detailed analysis
            where it's possible to see grouped statistics.<br/>
            <br/>
            Double-clicking an item will show the statistic in an editor and just selecting it will
            make it the current function in the callers/callees view.
        <br/>

        <br/>
        <br/>
            After selecting a function (in the grouped statistics or hotspots graph), 
            it's possible to navigate through callers and callees:<br/>
            <br/>
            Double-clicking the items for functions which called the
            current function or functions called by it will change the current function.<br/>
            <br/>
            Double-clicking the current function will open an editor where the given line may be seen.
        <br/>

        <br/>
        <br/>
            The last tab shows a view with graph showing the hotspots (layout powered by <a href="https://github.com/bdcht/grandalf">Grandalf</a>).<br/>
            <br/>
            Note that you may have multiple graphs: if you have multiple threads, there should be 
            one for each thread, but even if you have only a single thread you may still have
            multiple tabs as the profile results may be disconnected.

        <br/>
            Note: double-clicking the current function in the callers/callees or a graph node opens an editor to view the given file contents:
