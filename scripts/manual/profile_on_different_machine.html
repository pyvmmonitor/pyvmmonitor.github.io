It should be possible to profile Python programs in a different machine. In this example let's consider
that the client is a windows machine and the server a Linux machine.
<br/>
<br/>
To make the profile in this case you should:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Start pyvmmonitor-ui on your windows machine
<br/> 
<br/> 
2. Copy the contents of C:\bin\PyVmMonitor VERSION\public_api to the Linux machine
<br/> 
<br/> 
3. Add to the start of your code:
<br/> 
<br/> 
<pre style="font-family: Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace; color: #000000; background-color: #eee; font-size: 12px; border: 1px dashed #999999; line-height: 14px; padding: 5px; overflow: auto; width: 100%">
  <code style="color:#000000;word-wrap:normal;">
# Add the public_api to the PYTHONPATH (could be done by changing environment 
# variable or adding the contents inside public_api to site-packages too).
import sys
sys.path.append(r'/my/path/to/public_api') 

# Note that the port may be different... in the 
# right-bottom corner of pyvmmonitor it'll show the port it's listening to.
import pyvmmonitor
pyvmmonitor.connect(host='my.windows.host.ip', port=5687)

</code></pre>
<br/>

By doing so it should connect to the pyvmmonitor ui at startup.
<br/>
<br/>
It should start showing the live-tree results at that point 
and if you have yappi installed on your server you could also start/stop a profile session interactively.
<br/>
<br/>
Another option would be following the steps above for setup and later using the 
pyvmmonitor.profile_method() decorator to make a deterministic profiling session.
