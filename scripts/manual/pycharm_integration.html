        To install PyVmMonitor in PyCharm, use the plugin manager bundled in PyCharm and look for
        PyVmMonitor:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <img style="width: 900px; max-width: 900px; height: 414px" src="images/pycharm_install_plugin.png"/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        After it's installed, use the PyVmMonitor item which now appears in the toolbar to
        configure the PyVmMonitor location and start making runs with profiling enabled.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <img src="images/pycharm_config.png"/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Note that it's possible to change the profile mode globally through the toolbar or
        per run configuration (as the screen below shows).
