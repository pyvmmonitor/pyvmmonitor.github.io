        <p>
        For added flexibility, it's possible to use PyVMMonitor programatically so that a profile
        session can be started/stopped and PyVMMonitor shows the results of the profile session
        afterwards.
        </p>
        
        To connect an application to PyVMMonitor (so that it's possible to start/stop profiling),
        use the code below (changing "PYVMMONITOR_INSTALL_DIR" to the appropriate location).
        
        <pre style="font-family: Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace; color: #000000; background-color: #eee; font-size: 12px; border: 1px dashed #999999; line-height: 14px; padding: 5px; overflow: auto; width: 100%">
          <code style="color:#000000;word-wrap:normal;">import sys
sys.path.append(r'PYVMMONITOR_INSTALL_DIR\public_api')
from pyvmmonitor import server
server.connect_to_pyvmmonitor()</code></pre>
