        The PyVmMonitor integration is bundled in PyDev itself (so, if you have a recent version of
        PyDev the integration should be available already). PyDev 4.0 onwards is recommended as it had improvements
        in the PyVmMonitor integration (especially on Linux and Mac OS).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The integration in PyDev happens through the 'Profile' view, so, to start make that view visible:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <img src="images/pydev_show_others.png"/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <img src="images/pydev_show_view.png"/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        And from that view you can select to start the profiler for new launches and the profile
        mode to be used.
        <br/>        
        <br/>        
        Also, check if the PyVmMonitor executable points to the proper location.
